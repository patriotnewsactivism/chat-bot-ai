# BuildMyBot Affiliate/Reseller Program Documentation

## üìã PROGRAM OVERVIEW

The BuildMyBot Affiliate/Reseller Program is a comprehensive two-tier revenue sharing system designed to reward partners for bringing new customers to our platform. This document outlines the technical implementation, tracking mechanisms, and commission structure.

## üéØ TWO-TIER COMMISSION STRUCTURE

### Direct Referrals (50% Commission)
- Partners earn 50% of the subscription payment for every customer they directly refer
- Applies to all subscription tiers (Starter, Professional, Business)
- Commission is calculated on the actual subscription amount (after any discounts)

### Indirect Referrals (20% Commission)
- Partners earn 20% of the commission that their referrals earn
- This is 20% of the 50% commission, not 20% of the subscription payment
- Example: If your referral earns $50 commission, you earn $10 (20% of $50)

### Volume Bonuses (Up to 10%)
- Additional bonuses for high-volume partners
- Tier 1: 10+ active referrals - 2% bonus
- Tier 2: 25+ active referrals - 5% bonus
- Tier 3: 50+ active referrals - 10% bonus

## üîß TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### Rewardful Integration
BuildMyBot uses Rewardful as our affiliate tracking platform. The integration is implemented through:

1. **Tracking Script**: 
```html
<script src="https://rwdcdn.com/js/v1/rewardful.js" data-rewardful="YOUR_REWARDFUL_ID"></script>
```

2. **Conversion Tracking**:
```javascript
Rewardful('convert', { email: 'customer@example.com' });
```

3. **Referral Links**:
Partners receive unique referral links in the format:
`https://buildmybot.app/affiliates?via=PARTNER_ID`

### Stripe Integration
All subscription payments are processed through Stripe with:
- Customer portal for subscription management
- Webhook handling for payment events
- Automatic commission calculation
- Payout scheduling through Rewardful

## üìä TRACKING AND REPORTING

### Real-Time Dashboard
Partners have access to a comprehensive dashboard showing:
- Total referrals and active customers
- Commission earnings (current and historical)
- Tier 2 referrals and indirect earnings
- Performance metrics and conversion rates
- Marketing materials and resources

### Data Points Tracked
1. Referral link clicks
2. Sign-ups through referral links
3. Subscription conversions
4. Payment processing
5. Commission calculations
6. Payout status

## üí∞ COMMISSION CALCULATION EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Direct Referral
- Customer signs up for Professional plan ($99/month)
- Direct partner earns: $99 √ó 50% = $49.50/month

### Example 2: Indirect Referral
- Tier 1 partner refers customer to Tier 2 partner
- Customer signs up for Business plan ($299/month)
- Tier 2 partner earns: $299 √ó 50% = $149.50/month
- Tier 1 partner earns: $149.50 √ó 20% = $29.90/month

### Example 3: Volume Bonus
- Partner has 30 active referrals
- Monthly commissions total $2,000
- Volume bonus (5%): $2,000 √ó 5% = $100
- Total earnings: $2,000 + $100 = $2,100
