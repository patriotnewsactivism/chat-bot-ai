## 2. Intelligent Response Templates

### Conversation Definition Responses

```javascript
const conversationResponses = {
  // Direct question about conversations
  "what is a conversation": `Great question! 

A **conversation** is a complete interaction session between a user and your chatbot. Here's what that means:

üìä **Simple Definition:**
Multiple messages within the same session = 1 conversation

üîç **Example:**
If a customer asks:
- "What are your hours?" 
- "Are you open weekends?"
- "What about holidays?"

All in the same chat session, that counts as **1 conversation** (even though there are 6 messages total).

‚è±Ô∏è **Session Rules:**
- Same session = 1 conversation
- New session (after 30 min timeout) = new conversation
- User returns later = new conversation

üí° **What This Means for You:**
On our Starter plan ($29/mo), you get 1,000 conversations. If each customer has an average 5-message conversation, that's 1,000 customer interactions per month!

Want to see how many conversations your business might need? I can help you estimate!`,

  // Follow-up questions
  "how many messages in a conversation": `A conversation can have **any number of messages**! 

Here's how it works:

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Single message:** 
   User: "What are your hours?"
   Bot: "9 AM - 6 PM"
   = 1 conversation

5Ô∏è‚É£ **Five messages:**
   User asks 3 questions, bot gives 3 answers, user says thanks
   = Still 1 conversation (same session)

üîÑ **The key is the SESSION:**
- As long as the chat window stays open and active (within 30 minutes)
- All messages count as ONE conversation
- Only when the session ends (user closes chat or 30 min timeout) does it become a new conversation

üìà **Average conversation length:**
Most businesses see 3-5 messages per conversation.

Does this help clarify? Want to know more about our pricing plans?`,

  "what counts as a conversation": `Let me break down exactly what counts (and doesn't count) as a conversation:

‚úÖ **COUNTS as a conversation:**
- Each unique user session
- Multiple back-and-forth messages in same session = 1 conversation
- User returns after 30+ minutes = new conversation
- Different users = separate conversations

‚ùå **DOESN'T COUNT:**
- Bot messages alone (no user input)
- System notifications
- Error messages
- Your test messages from the dashboard
- Admin testing

üìä **Real Example:**
Monday 10 AM: Customer asks about pricing ‚Üí 1 conversation
Monday 3 PM: Same customer returns to ask about features ‚Üí 2nd conversation
(Because they're separate sessions)

But if they asked about pricing AND features in the same chat session, that's still just 1 conversation!

Need help estimating how many conversations you'll need?`,

  "conversation limit": `Here's what happens when you reach your conversation limit:

üö´ **At 100% (limit reached):**
- Your chatbot pauses automatically
- Visitors see: "This chatbot has reached its monthly limit. Please contact us directly at [your email]"
- You get an email notification

‚ö†Ô∏è **At 80% (warning):**
- You get a notification: "You've used 80% of your conversations"
- Prompt to upgrade or add more conversations

üí° **Your Options:**
1. **Upgrade your plan** - Get more conversations permanently
2. **Buy add-on** - Add 500 conversations for $10 (one-time, current month only)
3. **Wait** - Limit resets on 1st of next month

üìà **Pro Tip:**
Most businesses upgrade to Professional ($79/mo, 5,000 conversations) because:
- You never worry about limits
- Better features (GPT-4, integrations, analytics)
- Only $2.64/day for unlimited customer support!

## 5. Testing Scenarios

### Test Questions

```javascript
const testQuestions = [
  // Conversation definition
  "What is a conversation?",
  "What counts as a conversation?",
  "How many messages are in a conversation?",
  "What happens when I reach my conversation limit?",
  "Do test messages count as conversations?",
  
  // Pricing
  "How much does it cost?",
  "What's the difference between plans?",
  "Do you have a free plan?",
  "How much do I save with annual plans?",
  "What's included in the Professional plan?",
  
  // Features
  "What features do you have?",
  "Do I need to code?",
  "What integrations do you support?",
  "Can I customize the chatbot?",
  "Do you have analytics?",
  
  // Legal
  "Do you have a legal chatbot?",
  "Is it ABA compliant?",
  "How much is the legal chatbot?",
  
  // Affiliate
  "Do you have an affiliate program?",
  "How much commission do affiliates earn?",
  "How do affiliate payouts work?",
  
  // Complex questions
  "I have a law firm with 3 attorneys. We get about 50 client inquiries per day. Which plan should I get?",
  "What's the ROI of using BuildMyBot?",
  "How does your pricing compare to competitors?",
  "Can I start with free and upgrade later?"
];
```

1. ‚úÖ Direct answer to the question

3. ‚úÖ Relevant context
4. ‚úÖ Next steps or call to action
5. ‚úÖ Friendly, conversational tone

  // Track which questions are asked most
  "most_asked_questions": [
    "What is a conversation?",
    "How much does it cost?",
    "Do you have a free plan?"
  ],
  
  // Track which questions the bot struggles with
  "low_confidence_responses": [
    "Questions requiring human judgment",
    "Very specific technical questions",
    "Questions about future features"
  ],
  
  // Track conversion
  "conversion_triggers": [
    "User asks about pricing ‚Üí Show pricing",
    "User asks about free plan ‚Üí Encourage signup",
    "User asks complex question ‚Üí Offer demo call"
  ]
};
```
