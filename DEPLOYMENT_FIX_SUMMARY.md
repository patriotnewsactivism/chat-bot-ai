# Deployment Issue Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The buildmybot.app website was not reflecting the latest changes from PR #12. Specifically, the reseller commission structure was showing incorrect information:
- **Incorrect**: "Recruit other resellers and earn 50% on their sales too"
- **Correct**: "Recruit other resellers and earn 20% on their sales"

## Root Cause
The live website at buildmybot.app is a **React application** that uses the `src/pages/Index.tsx` component, NOT the standalone `buildmybot-landing-page.html` file.

PR #12 only updated the `buildmybot-landing-page.html` file, but the actual deployed site uses the React components in the `src/` directory.

## Solution Applied
Updated the `src/pages/Index.tsx` file with the correct commission structure:

### Changes Made:
1. **Line 158**: Changed commission text from "earn 50% on their sales too" to "earn 20% on their sales"
2. **Line 129**: Updated description to clarify: "Earn 50% on your direct sales and 20% on sales from resellers you recruit"

### Correct Commission Structure:
- **Direct Sales**: 50% recurring commission
- **Recruited Reseller Sales**: 20% commission

## Deployment Status
- ✅ Changes committed to main branch
- ✅ Changes pushed to GitHub repository
- ⏳ Waiting for automatic deployment to buildmybot.app

## Next Steps
The website should automatically redeploy with the correct information. If using:
- **Netlify**: Check the Netlify dashboard for deployment status
- **Vercel**: Check the Vercel dashboard for deployment status
- **Other platforms**: Trigger a manual rebuild if automatic deployment doesn't occur

## Files Updated
- `src/pages/Index.tsx` - Main landing page React component (LIVE SITE)
- `buildmybot-landing-page.html` - Standalone HTML version (NOT USED ON LIVE SITE)

## Important Note
Going forward, any changes to the landing page content should be made in **both**:
1. `src/pages/Index.tsx` (for the live React site)
2. `buildmybot-landing-page.html` (for the standalone version)

Or consider consolidating to use only one version to avoid this confusion.
