  alt: string;
  title?: string;
  width?: number;
  height?: number;
  className?: string;
  loading?: 'lazy' | 'eager';
  sizes?: string;
  srcSet?: string;
}

export const ImageComponent: React.FC<ImageComponentProps> = ({
  src,
  alt,
  title,
  width,
  height,
  className = "",
  loading = 'lazy',
  sizes,
  srcSet
}) => {
  return (
    <>
      <LazyLoadImage
        src={src}
        alt={alt}
        title={title}
        width={width}
        height={height}
        className={className}
        effect="blur"
        threshold={100}
        wrapperClassName="lazy-wrapper"
        sizes={sizes}
        srcSet={srcSet}
        loading={loading}
      />
      
      {/* Fallback for older browsers */}
      <noscript>
