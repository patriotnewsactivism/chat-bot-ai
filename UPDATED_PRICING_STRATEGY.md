## 3. Annual Discount Strategy (30% Off)

### Financial Analysis

**Monthly vs. Annual Revenue:**

**Starter Plan Example:**
- Monthly: $29/month √ó 12 = $348/year
- Annual: $244/year (30% off)
- Revenue difference: $104/year

**Affiliate Commission Impact:**
- Monthly plan: 50% of $29 = $14.50 (one-time)
- Annual plan: 50% of $244 = $122 (one-time)
- Your net (annual): $244 - $122 = $122 upfront

**Why 30% Works:**
1. **Cash flow:** Get $122 upfront vs. $14.50/month
2. **Retention:** Annual customers stay longer (lower churn)
3. **Affiliate incentive:** $122 commission is attractive
4. **Customer value:** Significant savings motivates annual purchase
5. **Competitive:** Industry standard is 20-30% for annual

### Affiliate Commission Structure with Annual Plans

**Monthly Plans:**
- Affiliate earns: 50% of first month only
- Example (Starter): $14.50 one-time

**Annual Plans:**
- Affiliate earns: 50% of annual payment
- Example (Starter): $122 one-time
- **This is better for affiliates** - they prefer annual sales

**Clause for Protection:**
```
Affiliate Commission Terms:
- Monthly subscriptions: 50% of first month's payment
- Annual subscriptions: 50% of annual payment
- Refunds: If customer requests refund within 30 days, 
  commission is reversed/deducted from affiliate's next payout
- Chargebacks: Commission automatically reversed
- Cancellations: No impact on already-paid commission
```

## 4. What Counts as a "Conversation"?

### Definition

**A conversation is defined as:**
> A complete interaction between a user and the chatbot, consisting of one or more message exchanges, that begins when a user initiates contact and ends when either:
> 1. The user closes the chat window
> 2. The session times out after 30 minutes of inactivity
> 3. The user explicitly ends the conversation

### Examples

**Scenario 1: Single Question**
- User: "What are your business hours?"
- Bot: "We're open Monday-Friday, 9 AM - 6 PM EST."
- User closes chat
- **Result:** 1 conversation

**Scenario 2: Multi-Turn Conversation**
- User: "What are your business hours?"
- Bot: "We're open Monday-Friday, 9 AM - 6 PM EST."
- User: "Are you open on weekends?"
- Bot: "No, we're closed on weekends."
- User: "What about holidays?"
- Bot: "We're closed on major US holidays."
- User closes chat
- **Result:** 1 conversation (multiple messages, but one session)

**Scenario 3: Multiple Sessions**
- **Session 1 (10:00 AM):**
  - User: "What are your prices?"
  - Bot: "Our plans start at $29/month."
  - User closes chat
- **Session 2 (2:00 PM - same user returns):**
  - User: "Can I get a demo?"
  - Bot: "Yes! Click here to schedule."
  - User closes chat
- **Result:** 2 conversations (separate sessions)

**Scenario 4: Timeout**
- User: "What are your prices?"
- Bot: "Our plans start at $29/month."
- User leaves page open but doesn't respond for 35 minutes
- Session times out
- User returns and types: "Tell me more"
- Bot: "Hello! How can I help you today?"
- **Result:** 2 conversations (timeout created new session)

### Conversation Counting Rules

**What Counts:**
‚úÖ Each unique user session
‚úÖ Multiple messages within same session = 1 conversation
‚úÖ New session after timeout = new conversation
‚úÖ Same user returning later = new conversation
‚úÖ Different users = separate conversations

**What Doesn't Count:**
‚ùå Bot messages alone (no user input)
‚ùå System messages or notifications
‚ùå Failed/error messages
‚ùå Test messages from dashboard
‚ùå Admin/owner testing

### Dashboard Display

**Real-Time Counter:**
