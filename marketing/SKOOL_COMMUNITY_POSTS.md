üîß BUILDING CHATFORGE: LESSONS LEARNED

3 things I learned building BuildMyBot:

1. Setup shouldn't take weeks
Most platforms require developers and complex integrations. We built copy/paste deployment.

2. Design matters
Professional appearance = trust. That's why we use clean dark blue theme (not purple!).

3. Mobile is critical
60% of traffic is mobile. We designed mobile-first, not mobile-afterthought.

The result? A chatbot platform that actually works for small businesses.
