# BuildMyBot Referral Program Implementation

## Program Overview

BuildMyBot offers a generous referral program designed to reward our users for spreading the word about our platform. This program creates a win-win situation where both the referrer and the new customer benefit.

## Referral Program Structure

### Standard Customer Referrals
- **Reward:** 1 FREE month of service for every successful referral
- **Eligibility:** All current BuildMyBot customers
- **Requirement:** Referred business must sign up and remain active for at least 30 days

### Affiliate/Reseller Referrals
- **Base Commission:** 50% of the first month's subscription fee
- **Ongoing Commission:** 50% monthly commission as long as the referred customer remains active
- **Two-Tier Commission:** 20% of the commission earned by affiliates you refer to the program

## Cost Sharing Model for Free Months

### Standard Customer Referrals
- **Cost Coverage:** 100% covered by BuildMyBot
- **Rationale:** Customer acquisition cost offset by long-term customer value

### Affiliate/Reseller Referrals with Free Month
- **Cost Split:** 50% BuildMyBot, 50% Affiliate/Reseller
- **Logic:** 
  - BuildMyBot covers 50% = $24.50
  - Affiliate covers 50% = $24.50 (forgoing their commission)
  - Creates "skin in the game" for both parties
  - Ensures quality referrals from invested partners
