# BuildMyBot Reseller Program Documentation

## Introduction
Welcome to the BuildMyBot Reseller Program! This program allows you to earn 50% recurring commissions on all BuildMyBot subscriptions referred by you or your recruited resellers. As a reseller, you'll have access to our powerful AI chatbot platform and can earn passive income by sharing it with others.

## How It Works

### Two-Tier Commission Structure
1. **Direct Referrals**: Earn 50% commission on every subscription payment from customers you directly refer
2. **Two-Tier Referrals**: Earn 50% commission on every subscription payment from customers referred by resellers you recruit (25% of the subscription price)

### Example Earnings
If you refer a customer who subscribes to our Pro plan ($99/month):
- You earn $49.50 each month as long as they remain subscribed
- If that customer becomes a reseller and refers someone to the Business plan ($299/month):
  - They earn $149.50/month
  - You earn $74.75/month (50% of their commission)

### Vesting Schedule
Commissions vest immediately upon payment processing and continue for as long as the referred customer maintains an active subscription. There's no limit on how long you can earn commissions from a single referral.
